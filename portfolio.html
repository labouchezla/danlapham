    <h2 class="h2">Barclays - Federated Organic Performance</h2>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Executive Business Director (OMD UK)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Financial services multi-business-unit requiring a unified and scalable approach to Organic Performance.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Organic activity fragmented across business units, with inconsistent governance and limited visibility of impact.

    <p>
      Designed a federated SEO operating model supported by a central centre of excellence and stream-aligned teams.
      Strengthened governance, delivery rituals and strategic planning to ensure consistency and scale.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Increased investment in organic performance by 40% year on year, improved senior visibility, and established a long-term roadmap for BAU effectiveness and future search readiness.</li>

    <h2 class="h2">Barclaycard UK - Credit basics on-site content</h2>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Executive Business Director (OMD UK)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Financial services requiring a content strategy that would close credit knowledge gaps for Barclaycard consumers and capture new customers at the awareness and research stages of the customer journey.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      On-site content mostly consisted of transactional pieces designed for much lower in the funnel, and production challenges required a laser-focus on content that had the greatest potential to drive commercial outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Provided a full end-to-end process, from opportunity discovery to strategic recommendations through to content creation and performance tracking.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">

    <h2 class="h2">Mercedes-Benz - Total Search integration</h2>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Executive Business Director (OMD UK)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Automotive brand seeking to unify performance channels to better capture demand across the funnel.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Search and paid media teams operated in silos, with separate measurement frameworks and no shared planning cadence.
      This limited the brand’s ability to optimise against real user journeys and reduced the efficiency of spend and content.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Cross-agency collaboration to form a Total Search governance model that aligned SEO, PPC, content and UX activity around shared intent signals.
      Established unified reporting in GA4 and Looker Studio and co-created integrated briefing processes to improve collaboration.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Improved team alignment and cost efficiency, leading to increased investment in organic brand protection strategy and increased coverage of high-value terms, including 195K in additional organic traffic.</li>

  <!-- MERCEDES-BENZ VANS -->
  <article id="mercedes-benz-vans" class="case section">
    <h2 class="h2">Mercedes-Benz Vans - Search cannibalisation solutions</h2>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Executive Business Director (OMD UK)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Automotive brand proposing a unique workaround in order to minimise traffic loss from post-migration inefficiencies.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Post site migration, Mercedes-Benz Vans (US website) was capturing on average 18% of UK traffic due to a poor internationalisation strategy, leading to poor user experience and potential revenue loss.
      Because the US market was managed by a different team, on a different platform, it was not possible to impact the US source code directly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Liaised with US counterparts to implement a workaround, instigating hreflang sitemaps specifically for UK and US markets, whilst simultaneously managing source code hreflang implementation for European markets.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>£73.7K estimated savings in PPC spend annually and a 120% increase in UK traffic to the brand’s critical Sprinter page.</li>

    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Executive Business Director (OMD UK)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Fashion retailer seeking to consolidate digital real estate with a multi-market domain migration.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Over a 17-month period, four domains as well as a CMS migration were moved into a single domain, putting at risk 40% of traffic (organic was Clarks’ single biggest traffic driver) and £45m revenue, where organic revenue was driven by 1.4m transactions.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Ensured all fundamental areas of SEO were optimised and redirect rules methodically put in place.
      Formed a unique risk register and response framework to minimise issues and delays and effectively manage more than 40 stakeholders.
      Built PPC integration into the project, ready to close any drops in search visibility.

    <p><strong>Role:</strong> SEO Director (Blue Array)</p>
    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Fashion retailer aiming to accelerate organic growth following site migration.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The site had authority loss through legacy URLs and an unstructured approach to blog, category and product pages, which prevented Monsoon from capturing high-intent demand.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Introduced a structured organic strategy that combined technical architecture improvements related to filters and facets, consolidation of legacy URLs to preserve backlink equity, and content optimisation at scale across templates.
      Improved sitewide technical hygiene to strengthen crawl efficiency and ranking potential.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Delivered a year-on-year increase of +180 percent in organic clicks and achieved +537 additional Positions 1 to 3.</li>

    <p><strong>Context:</strong> Large publisher seeking to modernise mobile architecture and reduce dependency on AMP (accelerated mobile pages).</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      AMP had created technical debt, complexity in maintenance and inconsistent monetisation.
      Deprecating it carried risk to organic traffic and revenue, requiring a carefully staged strategy and performance modelling.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Audited AMP templates and created a phased rollout plan to mitigate risk.
      Modelled performance outcomes, validated technical requirements and provided change management support for internal teams.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Impact</h3>
